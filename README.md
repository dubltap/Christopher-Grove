## About
I’m a **Convergence Architect** who bridges **audio/broadcast engineering**, **industrial automation (PLC/SCADA/IIoT)**, and **applied AI/LLM systems**. I build reliable systems that work _with_ humans: agentic workflows, safety-aware AI, and production-grade automation.

- 40 years across studios, factory floors, and intelligent systems  
- Published author, professional musician, and builder of production AI agents  
- Focused on **human-in-the-loop** design, reliability, and scale
